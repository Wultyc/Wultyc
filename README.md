Hi, I'm Jorge. I'm a portuguese developer and I'm very happy you found my profile here on github. I'm always thinking in amazing things to do with techonology.

Want to know more about me and my work? Nice! Visit my website [jgabriel.eu](http://jgabriel.eu) and take a look on my the awsome things I'm making. You can also visit my [notebook](http://notebook.jgabriel.eu). There I host all content I create, since project documentation, notes about anything or just some posts about whatever topic.

Here some things I like to do
- 💻 Developing some projects
- 🎮 Play video games
- 🚗 Go drive with my family or my frinds
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Having fun with my family and my frinds
